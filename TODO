Use pointer/button motion event instead of XQueryPointer every frame.
Use directional audio when using mpv.
Optimize mpv rendering option. Causes stuttering for some reason while capturing a mpv window does not.
Dynamically load mpv (with dlopen) when using the --video option instead of linking to it at compile time.
Show mpv gui.
Allow setting/changing video at runtime.
Automatically use the right vr option when using mpv by looking at the file name (or file metadata?). There is a standard in filenames to specify the vr format.
Use libmpv. Make stereo audio follow headset rotation in 180/360 mode (assume facing forward is the default audio mode).
Fix sphere360... AAAAAA
